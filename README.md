# BOOK-APP
This mini web application demonstrates how to create a complete book registration system using a simple tech stack. The backend is built using Node.js and Express and exposes two API endpoints: GET /books to retrieve all stored books and POST /books to insert a new book into the database. The database contains a single table named Book with fields such as book_id, title, author, and price. On the frontend, an HTML page with embedded JavaScript fetches the list of books from the backend and displays them in a table, while also offering a form for adding new book records. This project serves as a beginner-friendly example of how frontend, backend, and database interact in a real application.
